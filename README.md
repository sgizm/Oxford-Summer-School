The data science workshop was very intensive. First two days, we trained on Wolfram Mathematica software. 
I did not have prior experience with Wolfram Mathematica before and I found the program interesting. 
Mathematica is a computation program well known for technical computing such as machine learning and it uses Wolfram language, that is a multi-paradigm, functional language. 
Below is a sample of Mathematica code, where a dataset is divided into training and testing data and printing the summary.

Especially the sessions on understanding Supervised learning vs. Unsupervised learning vs. Reinforcement learning was very interesting for me. 
Furthermore, a learnt about an unsupervised machine learning technique called Associate rules learning, also known as "market basket analysis".
I have utilized many of these learning during my PhD research. Examples of these can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/sgizm/PhD-ML-analyses-)
